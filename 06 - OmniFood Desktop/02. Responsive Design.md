# Responsive Design ??

## What is Responsive Design !!

- Design technique to make a webpage adjust its layout and visual style to **any possible screen size** (window or viewport size)

- In practice, this means that responsive design makes websites usable on all devices, such as **desktop computers**, **tablets**, and **mobile phones**.

- It's a set of practices, **not a separate technology**. Its all just CSS!

## Responsive Design Ingredients !!

### Fluid Layouts

- To allow webpage to adapt to the current viewport width (or even height)
- Use % (or vh / vw) unit instead of px for elements that should adapt to viewport (usually layout)
- Use maxâ€”width instead Of width

### Responsive Units

- Use rem unit instead of px for most lengths To make it easy to scale the entire layout down (or up)automatically

- Helpful trick: setting 1 rem to 10px for easy calculations

### Flexible Images

- By default, images don't scale automatically as we change the viewport, so we need to fix that

- Always use % for image dimensions, together with the max-width property

### Media Queries

- Bring responsive sites to life!

- To change CSS styles on certain viewport widths (called breakpoints)

**NOTE** :

1. _So basically Media Queries allow developers to create different versions of website for different types of devices having different width._

2. _Media Queries alone are completely useless. We need to create fluid Layouts,Responsive Units & Flexible Images from the very beginning to use Media Queries effectively_

3. _We generally write the media queries at the very end of the project !!_
