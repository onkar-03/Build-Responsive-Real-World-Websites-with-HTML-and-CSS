# The Process behind Building a Website !!

## 7 Steps to Build a Great Website !!

### 1.0 Define the Project:

ðŸ‘‰ Define **WHO the website is for**. Is it for yourself? For a client of your agency or your freelancing business?

ðŸ‘‰ Define **WHAT the website is for**. In other words, define **business and user goals** of your website project (See lecture on UX)

ðŸ‘‰ Define a **target audience**. Be really specific if possible and if it makes sense for your website (this can come from your client)

**Example**:

**_Business Goal_**: Selling premium Dog Food

**_Consumer Goal_**: Finding Premium Dog Food

**_Target Audience_**: Say People, 20 to 40 years old, earning over 2000$/month, with a passion for dogs"

### 2.0 Planning the Project !!

ðŸ‘‰ Plan and gather website content: copy (text), images, videos, etc.

ðŸ‘‰ Content is usually **provided by the client**, but you also can help them produce and find some content (simply finding images is easiest, but if they want copy, charge them extra)

ðŸ‘‰ For bigger sites, plan out the sitemap: what pages the site needs, and how they are related to one another (content hierarchy)

ðŸ‘‰ Based on the content, plan what sections each page needs in order to convey the content's message, and in which order

### 3.0 Sketch Layout & Component Ideas !!

ðŸ‘‰ Think about what **components** you need, and how you can use them in **layout patterns** (Get inspiration in web design section)

ðŸ‘‰ **Get ideas out of your head**: sketch them with pen and paper or with some design software (e.g., Figma)

ðŸ‘‰ This is an **iterative process**: experiment with different components and layouts, until you arrive at a first good solution

ðŸ‘‰ You don't need to sketch everything, and **don't make it perfect**. At some point, you're ready to jump into HTML and CSS

### 4.0 Design & Build !!

ðŸ‘‰ Use decisions, content, and sketches from Steps 1, 2, and 3 to **design and build the website with HTML and CSS** ("designing in the browser")

ðŸ‘‰ You already have the layout and components that you selected in Step 3. In this step, you need to design the actual visual styles

ðŸ‘‰ Create the design based on selected website personality, the design guidelines I showed you, and inspiration (See web design section)

ðŸ‘‰ Use the client's branding (if it exists already) for design decisions whenever possible: colors, typography, icons, etc.

### 5.0 Test & Optimize !!

ðŸ‘‰ Make sure the website works well in all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, maybe even old IE)

ðŸ‘‰ Test the website on actual mobile devices, not just in DevTools

ðŸ‘‰ Optimize all images, in terms of dimensions and file size (See lecture on images)

ðŸ‘‰ Fix simple accessibility problems (e.g., color contrast issues)

ðŸ‘‰ Run the Lighthouse performance test in Chrome DevTools and try to fix reported issues

ðŸ‘‰ Think about Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

### 6.0 Launch the Masterpiece !!

ðŸ‘‰ Once all work is done, everything is perfect, and you got approval from your client (or yourself ðŸ˜Š), it's time to share your masterpiece with the world!

ðŸ‘‰ Upload your website files to a hosting platform. There are countless platforms; we will use one with a free plan (Netlify)

ðŸ‘‰ Choose and buy a great domain name, one that represents the brand well, is memorable and easy to write

### 7.0 Maintain & Update the Website !!

ðŸ‘‰ Launching is not the end...

ðŸ‘‰ Keep the website content updated over time. If you're working with a client, you can create a monthly maintenance contract (recurring revenue ðŸ’°)

ðŸ‘‰ Install analytics software (e.g., Google Analytics or Fathom) to get statistics about website users. This may inform future changes in the site structure and content.

ðŸ‘‰ A blog that is updated regularly is a good way to keep users coming back and is also good for SEO.
