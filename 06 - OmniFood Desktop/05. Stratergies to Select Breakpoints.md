# Strategies for Selecting Breakpoints

## Various approaches to select breakpoints !!

1. **Bad Strategy:**

   This approach, termed the "BAD strategy," involves optimizing for one specific device, such as the iPhone or iPad. However, this method has significant downsides:

   - Ignores other users with different devices, creating a suboptimal experience for them.
   - Posing a challenge for code maintenance and updates in the future, especially when new devices are released.

2. **Good Strategy:**

   The "GOOD strategy" introduces a more thoughtful approach based on screen width ranges. Instead of targeting individual devices, looking at the most used widths for various device categories like phones, tablets, and desktop computers. Key points include:

   - Grouping devices logically and selecting breakpoints between similar device sizes.
   - Avoiding setting breakpoints at one specific device, leading to a more adaptable and scalable design.

3. **Perfect Strategy:**

   The "PERFECT strategy" emphasizes setting breakpoints where the design breaks down, irrespective of specific devices.

   - Ignoring device classifications and focusing solely on content and design.
   - Beginning with one screen size and adjusting breakpoints as the design no longer looks acceptable.
   - Combining the PERFECT strategy with the GOOD strategy for an even better approach.
