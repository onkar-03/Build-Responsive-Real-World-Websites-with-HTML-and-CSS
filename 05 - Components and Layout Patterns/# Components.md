# Learning about Components

## 01.0 From Elements to Webpage !!

### 1. Elements :

- #### HTML (HyperText Markup Language) :

  - Define the structure and content of your webpage using HTML elements.
  - Examples include `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, `<p>`, `<h1>`, etc.

- #### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) :

  - Style your HTML elements using CSS.
  - Examples include setting colors, fonts, margins, padding, etc.

- #### JavaScript :

  - Add interactivity to your webpage using JavaScript.
  - Examples include handling user input, dynamic content, and making your webpage responsive.

### 2. Components :

- Break down your webpage into reusable components. This is especially relevant if you're using a framework like React, Vue, or Angular.

- Components encapsulate both the HTML structure and CSS styles, and sometimes even the JavaScript logic, making your code modular and maintainable.

### 3. Layout :

- #### CSS Flexbox/Grid:

  - Use Flexbox or Grid layout systems to arrange and align your components within sections of your webpage.
  - These provide flexible and powerful ways to create responsive layouts.

- #### CSS Media Queries:

  - Implement media queries in CSS to make your webpage responsive to different screen sizes and devices.

### 4. Webpage :

- #### HTML Structure:

  - Combine your components into the overall structure of your webpage.
  - Organize sections like header, navigation, main content, sidebar, and footer.

- #### CSS Styling:

  - Apply global styles to your webpage.
  - Ensure a consistent design by styling elements that are used across multiple components.

- #### JavaScript Integration:

  - Integrate any JavaScript functionalities that enhance the user experience, such as form validation, dynamic content loading, or interactive features.

- ### Testing:

  - Test your webpage in different browsers and devices to ensure compatibility.

- ### Deployment:

  - Choose a hosting solution and deploy your webpage for public access.

### What is `flex-direction: column`; ??

When using Flexbox in CSS, you can control the layout of your elements using various properties. Let's explore the `flex-direction`, `align-items`, `justify-content`, and the main and cross axes.

#### `flex-direction`

The `flex-direction` property defines the direction in which the flex container's main axis and cross axis are placed. By default, it is set to `row`. If you want a column layout, you would set it to `column`.

**_This makes the "main axis" run vertically and the "cross axis" run horizontally._**

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}
```

#### `align-items`

The `align-items` property controls how items are aligned on the cross axis. When using `flex-direction: column`, it aligns items horizontally. Common values are `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `stretch`, etc.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center; /* Align items in the center horizontally */
}
```

#### `justify-content` with `flex-direction: column`

The `justify-content` property controls how items are aligned on the main axis. When `flex-direction` is set to `column`, it affects the vertical alignment of items within the flex container.Common values are `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `space-between`, `space-around`.

Example:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center; /* Center items vertically along the main axis */
}
```

#### Main Axis and Cross Axis

When `flex-direction` is set to `column`, the main axis runs vertically, and the cross axis runs horizontally. This is opposite when `flex-direction` is set to `row`.

- **Main Axis:** The primary axis along which flex items are placed. For `flex-direction: column`, it's vertical.
- **Cross Axis:** The perpendicular axis to the main axis. For `flex-direction: column`, it's horizontal.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center; /* Align items in the center horizontally */
  justify-content: space-between; /* Space between items vertically */
}
```

In summary:

- **Main Axis (column):** Top to bottom.
- **Cross Axis (column):** Left to right.
