# Enhancing Visual Design: Applying Design Rules to Existing Webpage

The primary objective is to **elevate the visual design** of an existing webpage by implementing design principles within the provided HTML and CSS files. The desired outcome is a refined and visually appealing user interface.

## 01.0 Project Overview:

### Steps for Analysis:

1. **HTML File (`index.html`):**

   - Examine the overall structure of the HTML document.
   - Identify key sections such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<blockquote>`, `<footer>`, etc.
   - Understand the purpose of each section and the hierarchy of elements.

2. **CSS File (`style.css`):**
   - Review the CSS file to understand the styling applied to HTML elements.
   - Identify and analyze selectors for elements like `body`, `header`, `nav`, `section`, `blockquote`, `footer`, etc.
   - Examine the use of colors, fonts, margins, and padding for each element.

### HTML Element Analysis Report :

- [HTML File](./index.html)

During the analysis of the HTML file, several new HTML elements were identified. Here is an overview of the usage and purpose of these elements:

#### `<section>` Element:

- The `<section>` element is used to define sections within the HTML document. It helps in structuring the content by grouping related elements together.
- Sections are often used to organize content and provide a semantic meaning to the structure.

  Example :

  ```html
  <section>
    <h2>Section Heading</h2>
    <p>This is a section of your page. Use it to organize content.</p>
    <span>This is a span within the section.</span>
  </section>
  ```

#### `<span>` Element:

- The `<span>` element is an inline container that is used to apply styles to specific portions of text or content. It does not inherently change the structure or layout but can be styled using CSS to add emphasis or apply specific formatting.

  **Example:**

  ```html
  <span>This is a span within the section.</span>
  ```

#### `<blockquote>` Element:

- The `<blockquote>` element is used to represent a section that is quoted from another source. It is typically used to emphasize or highlight quoted text, providing a visual indication that the content is a quotation.

  **Example:**

  ```html
  <blockquote>
    <p>Here is a quote or citation. Use blockquote for emphasis.</p>
  </blockquote>
  ```

## 02.0 Overview of Web Design and Website Personalities :

### Web Design VS Web Developers

- **Web Designers:** They create the _overall look and feel_ of the website.
- **Web Developers:** They implement the design using HTML, CSS & JavaScript Code.

### Why Take Design Seriously?

- **Good Design:**

  - ✅ Creates an immediate and lasting good impression of the brand or product.
  - ✅ Makes the user trust the brand right away.
  - ✅ Increases the user's perceived value of the brand or product.
  - ✅ Gives users exactly what they were looking for when coming to the site, e.g. purchasing a product or finding information.

- **Bad Design:**
  - ❌ Makes users believe the brand doesn't really care about their product or service.
  - ❌ Makes the user insecure about trusting the brand.
  - ❌ Makes the brand or product seem "cheap".
  - ❌ Leaves users confused, and makes it hard for them to reach their goal.

### Anyone Can Learn Good Design!!

Good web design is not **subjective/creative**. Anyone can learn basics by following a **framework/system**.

### What Kind of Framework/System Will Teach Me This?

**Steps:**

1. Analyze 100's of well-designed websites & deconstruct those 100's of websites.
2. Distill them into easy-to-learn & easy-to-apply **rules**.
3. These rules are divided into 9 different areas of design: **ingredients**.
4. Rules will be applied based on **website personality**.

### Web Design Ingredients We Will Learn :

- _Typography_
- _Colors_
- _Images / Illustrations_
- _Icons_
- _Shadows_
- _border-radius_
- _Whitespace_
- _Visual Hierarchy_
- _User Experience_
- _Components / Layout_

_Design Decisions for each are based on website personality._
